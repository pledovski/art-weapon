    On last year’s Millennium Sun, Dmitriy Avksentiev grappled with futurism’s pleasures and terrors
    by revisiting the past. Inspired by classic science-fiction films like Blade Runner and Akira,
    the Ukrainian electronic musician, aka Koloah and Voin Oruwu, set out to craft an album about
    our own era, “where science and technology coexist with wars and dictatorship, where world
    hunger exists alongside space travel.” In keeping with that tangled timeline—which echoed an
    observation often attributed to William Gibson, “The future is already here; it’s just not
    evenly distributed yet”—the music’s high-tech overtones tangled with echoes of the past 30 years
    of electronic music, mixing alien textures with familiar strains of jungle and techno. There was
    a dystopian cast to some of the album’s darker moments, with pummeling breakbeats wreathed in
    minor-key synths, and TB-303 patterns dripping like acid rain. But placid ambient tones
    transmitted a message of cautious optimism.
